# zx-spectrum-test-expansion-board

## A test board to plug into the ZX Spectrum expansion port for dev use

This board is used to break out the signals from the expansion header for development use. All signals, except for power, are converted to 3.3V for use with modern microcontrollers. The buttons for WAIT and RESET are optional, but handy for development.

The production folder contains files to submit the board for PCBA production at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
